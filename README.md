## What is it?

**EssAI** is an open-source project (experiment/demo) designed to showcase how organizations can easily and quickly do essay grading for educators.  Leveraging the power of Google Gemini, EssAI automates the essay evaluation process, comparing student submissions against personalized rubrics. This innovative tool not only saves valuable time for educators but also provides near real-time feedback to students, enabling them to learn and improve more effectively.

EssAI aims to streamline the feedback loop in education, freeing up teachers to focus on individualized instruction and student interaction. By automating the often tedious task of grading, this project empowers educators to dedicate more time to what matters most: fostering student growth and understanding.  The open-source nature of EssAI encourages community contribution and ensures its continuous development and adaptation to the evolving needs of educators and students.
